Hi, I’m Kesar!  
I’m a Software Engineer passionate about designing scalable architectures on **AWS & Azure**, and automating workflows using **Bash & PowerShell**.  
I love building efficient **CI/CD pipelines** and optimizing cloud solutions for performance and reliability.  

When I’m not coding, I’m probably binge-watching OTT shows!
